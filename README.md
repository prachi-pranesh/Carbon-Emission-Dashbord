# Carbon Emission Project: SQL and PowerBI Analysis

*"The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it."*  
â€” Robert Swan

## Purpose:
Driven by a deep commitment to combating climate change, this project aims to analyze and visualize carbon emission data using SQL and PowerBI. By uncovering key insights such as the highest and lowest carbon emissions in America by year, and identifying the countries with the most significant and least significant changes in emissions per capita from 1975 to 2017, I hope to contribute to the global conversation on environmental sustainability.

### 2. About the Dataset:
#### a. Carbon Emission Database:
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vineethakkinapalli/united-nations-environment-data?select=Water+and+Sanitation+Services.csv)
- **Overview**: Contains data on carbon emissions per capita and total carbon emissions across various countries globally.
- **Tools Used**: SQL for data cleaning and analysis, PowerBI for visualization.

#### b. Reduced Carbon Emission Database:
- **Source**: [UN Environment Program](https://www.unep.org/interactive/six-sector-solution-climate-change/)
- **Purpose**: This project is driven by my deep concern for climate change and my desire to contribute to understanding and mitigating its impacts.
